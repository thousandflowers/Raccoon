# 🦝 Raccoon

> A Mac companion toolkit for power users.

Raccoon (`rcc`) is a lightweight Bash toolkit for macOS that surfaces the information and workflows you need most — network state, hardware health, package hygiene, SSH, Git — through a single unified CLI with an optional interactive menu.

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thousandflowers/Raccoon/main/install.sh | bash
```

Raccoon clones itself to `~/.raccoon` and symlinks `rcc` into `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` if `/usr/local/bin` is not writable). No external dependencies beyond standard macOS utilities and `git`.

---

## Usage

```
rcc [command] [options]
```

Run `rcc` with no arguments to open the interactive menu.

Or, if you prefer updating manually:

cd ~/.raccoon && git pull
```

rm -rf ~/.raccoon
rm /usr/local/bin/rcc   # or ~/.local/bin/rcc
```
